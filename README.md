# ðŸ§¬ ST--project

## Overview
This repository contains my work during the **Yalla Bioinformatics Internship**, focusing on **transcriptomics** analysis using R.

The project showcases exploratory data analysis, visualization, and interpretation of spatially-resolved transcriptomic data using state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools.

## Contents
- ðŸ“’ **Notebooks**: Complete R scripts and code notebooks used during the internship  
- ðŸ”¬ **Workflows**: Step-by-step analysis pipelines for ST data  
- ðŸ“Š **Visualizations**: Annotated figures, spatial plots, and heatmaps generated from the analysis

## Key Topics
- Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)
- Gene expression spatial mapping
- Tissue architecture and cellular heterogeneity
- Visualization of gene expression across tissue sections
- Data normalization and clustering
- Dimensionality reduction and annotation

## Tools and Packages Used
- `Seurat` / `SpatialExperiment`
- `KODAMA`
- `Cytospace`
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`, `tidyverse`
- `SingleCellExperiment`
- Other relevant Bioconductor and CRAN packages

## About the Internship
This work is part of the **Yalla Bioinformatics Internship**. The internship emphasizes real-world research skills through project-based learning and analysis of high-throughput biological data.
